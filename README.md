# PR-OS Source
This is the source code for my little AOSP project thingy. The goal is a stock+ experience, going as far as implementing all custom settings into the existing Settings app.

## Getting started

Sync and compile. This isn't a building tutorial. If you know what you're doing, this should be easy for you. If not, Google is your friend!
